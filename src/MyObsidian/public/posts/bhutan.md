### Ema Datshi is amazing.

Our second set of planning started with one question "How are we going to fake Yak's cheese?". 
It was clear from clicking the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q={{title}}+national+dish">National Dish</a> link above that we were making Ema Datshi (Chilli and Cheese).
And it quickly became clear that we weren't going to get Yak's cheese so we choosing which fake yak's cheese became the major thing. Eventually we settled on a mix of Feta and Roquefort 
(and I've made it succesfully  with Feta & Stilton since).

Ema Datshi is amazingly simple to make and so so tasty, just be careful handling the chilli. It's going on rotation in my house and I think our guests were of the same opinion.


### Khabzay is tricky

I'm not a good baker, I'll have a go at any cooking but put more than a few tablespoons of flour in something and I get bad fast.

It took me 2 different Khabzay recipes and most of 1kg of flour to make the dough thin enough and the oil temperature low enough 
to work. But the ones that were nice were pretty nice.
